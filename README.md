# TIMCI-reports

This repository contains several markdown and files used to generate automated reports from **audit log data**. 
The data comes from forms generated with ODK and stored on Digital Ocean.
The **audit log files** are generated automatically for each form in a standardized fashion by ODK Central.

In the 'Fucntion scripts' folder, all functions in the subfolders **'formatting-manipulation' and 'ruODK'** are generic.
The rest of the funtions were written for individual purposes in Swiss TPH's 'Tools for Integrated Management of Childhood Illness' project.
